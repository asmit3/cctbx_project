this directory contains all the work related to exgaussian fitting of XFEL intensity data. 
The main script to run is mcmc_exgauss.py. It does the following - 
1) First does a least squares fit using the LevMar minimizer (the class used is exgauss_fit)
2) It then does an MCMC (markov chain monte carlo) simulation to vary the parameters, [mu,sigma,tau]. This is implemented in
   the class mcmc (located in file test3_logarithm.py)

You can use the class mcmc_exgauss as a plugin. Just do "from scitbx.lstbx.tests.exgaussian.mcmc_exgauss import mcmc_exgauss"
An example is shown in test_mcmc.py.

The parameters you need to give to this class are 
1) filename (usually on the command line as sys.argv)
2) A CDF cutoff [default = 0.95]
3) # of steps of MCMC [default=50,000]
4) # of burn-in steps [default=40,000]
5) # of thinning steps [default=1000]
6) MCMC seed [default=##FIXME##]
7) whether to plot stuff [default=False]
